This repository contains my daily coding practice for Flutter development, from beginner to advanced topics. I am a beginner myself, so this is a journey of learning and growth together.

##Motivation

Flutter is a popular cross-platform development framework for building mobile, web, and desktop applications with a single codebase. It is easy to learn and use, but it can be challenging to master.

I started this daily coding practice to improve my Flutter skills and to build a portfolio of projects. I also hope to inspire other beginner Flutter developers to join me on this journey.
